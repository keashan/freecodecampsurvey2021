# freecodecampsurvey2021
 
Here, I'm doing some analysis about freecodecamp new coder survey data using python. All my work in the ipynb file. See below description to get more details about the charts and isights.
# Part 01
This part anaysis the outputs which has one response per column (radio button selections with or without other). I identified some fields allow users to type their response and have many different feedbacks. Those responses are processed to have reduced responses with other option.
# Part 02
Here I analysed subset of main data. 
Selected all responses have "White" as their response for "25. With which of these groups do you primarily identify?". Then did some anlaysis I did on Part 01
# Part 03
Same as Part 02, I selected "Female" responses from the "24. Which of the following best represents how you think of yourself?" and dis some anlaysis I did on Part 01
# Part 04
Here, I tried to develop some charts for the fields which has more than one responses (check box selection).
